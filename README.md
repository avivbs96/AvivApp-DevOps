In this project i write you each step of the following requirements as it appears on the final project pdf.

.I want to say also that i add all the jenkins job i did into one pipeline called Final Project Pipeline (that can run every cron time i will add to jenkins)

I attached here another screenshot of the pipeline console output that summaries all the jobs automatically.
